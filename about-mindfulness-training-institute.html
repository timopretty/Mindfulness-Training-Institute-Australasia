        <h1>Mindfulness Training Institute Australasia<br />
        <br />
        </h1>
        <p>The Mindfulness Training Institute is a not-for-profit organization committed to providing excellent and sustainable professional training in mindfulness-based approaches in Australasia. &nbsp;The Institute has an Educational Advisory Committee consisting of senior national and international teachers, researchers and academics to ensure that the direction of the institute is in touch with world-wide best practice as well as having the ability to respond to local needs and conditions. &nbsp;We wish to express our appreciation and gratitude to our teachers, colleagues, participants and students over the years who have contributed in direct and indirect ways to the formation of this training institute. The explorations, discoveries and challenges which have emerged out of this engagement have inspired us and led to greater clarity and enthusiasm for this work. &nbsp;</p>

        <h2><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Why establish an Australasian institute for professional training?</span></h2>
        <p>Over the past 30 years there has been an explosion of interest in the use of mindfulness interventions in the fields of health, education, business and community development.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dangers and possibilities inherent in this rapid spread of mindfulness-based interventions into a wide variety of secular settings. &nbsp; The benefits include the possibility of people in mainstream settings getting access to a tradition of practice that invites an understanding of one's interior world, to train one's minds in a useful direction, and to thereby radically transform one's relationship to oneself, one's problems and life - in ways which are liberating. &nbsp;The dangers lie in the dilution of the tradition, so that it loses it's integrity and power.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The intervention will only be as good as the teacher who delivers it, and&nbsp;</span>their<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;grasp and embodiment of the practice in their own lives and&nbsp;</span>teaching practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Out of this awareness, we&nbsp;</span>have<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;been motivated to&nbsp;</span>develop<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;a high quality, transformative and rigorous training experience for those wishing to develop these skills and knowledge locally.</span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp; We have&nbsp;</span>developed<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;a training pathway which maintains strong connections with&nbsp;the contemplative traditions out of which MBIs have&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">developed, </span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">and</span> with the contemporary scientific exploration of mindfulness. &nbsp;In this way, we hope that the mindfulness programs offered in the region are&nbsp;efficacious, contextually relevant, ethical and evidence-based. &nbsp;The word &ldquo;Australasia&rdquo;reflects our past engagement and requests for training from people from in Asia and NZ to provide the face-to-face training in different places in the region, so that people do not have to travel to Australia for this training.</p>

        <span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">We hope that the &nbsp;training will offer a grounding in the relational, cognitive, emotional and body-based personal and professional development work necessary for good teaching. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The training is targeted towards health professionals and others who wish:</span>
