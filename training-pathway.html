        <h1>Training Pathway in Brief</h1>
        <p> The training pathway may be undertaken with some flexibility by students within their own time frame.  The training is divided into two stages:</p>
        <h3>LEVEL 1:  Mindfulness Foundations and Development</h3>

        <p> This program offers an experiential and theoretical grounding in mindfulness for those who are working in the helping professions and are interested in incorporating mindfulness in their work as coaches, teachers, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, researchers and group facilitators.  It will provide a solid base on which to bring secular mindfulness practice into these contexts in a way which is skillful, ethical and relevant. (It will also provide a strong base for those wishing to go on to Level II of the program.)&nbsp;</p>

        HOW TO GET THERE<br />
        Go to the end of the path until you get to the gate.
        <p>Go through the gate and head straight out towards the horizon.</p>
        <p>Keep going towards the horizon.</p>
        <p>Sit down and have a rest every now and again,</p>
        <p>But keep on going, just keep on with it.</p>
        <p>Keep on going as far as you can.</p>
        <p>That's how you get there.<br />
