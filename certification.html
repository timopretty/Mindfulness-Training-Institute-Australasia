        <h3><strong>Discussion</strong></h3>
        <p>There are some inherent tensions in developing an assessment process regarding the competence of mindfulness teachers. &nbsp;This is captured elegantly by Crane et al: &nbsp;</p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">For example, the traditional language of workplace
        competence includes the expression </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">performance</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">roles</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">. It
        is not possible to conceive of mindfulness as an </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">add-on</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">, or for
        the teaching process to be seen as a set of techniques, a
        collection of skills which can be learned. Rather, the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">way of
        being</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">which emerges through sustained engagement with the
        practice becomes an integral part of the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">person of the teacher</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo;
        </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">(McCown et al. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #3a2a97;">2010</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">), not a role which is performed. A
        second example of this tension relates to the risk of duality
        which the language of and focus on competence can create.
        There can be a shift in perspective towards </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">right</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">and
        </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">wrong</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">, judgement, opinion and a focus on </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">my</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">teaching
        process and </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&lsquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">my</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">&rsquo; </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">competence. These mind states lead away
        from the capacity to be open and connected and towards
        identification and separation. Whereas, inherent within mindfulness teaching is the message that there are universal aspects
        to the experience of being human: centrally, that we </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">all
        </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #131313;">experience suffering, which ultimately comes from ignorance
        about ourselves and the nature of reality. Mindfulness practice
        leads us to see more clearly the ways we fuel our suffering and
        opens us to experiencing our connection with others. &nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/documents/Competencyarticle_000.pdf" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.428571429;">Mindfulness (2012) 3:76&ndash;84</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

        </span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">However, there may be wisdom in examining wh</span>at&nbsp;</span>constitutes<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;competence in mindfulness teaching and offering a&nbsp;</span>certification<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;process. For the trainees, certification provides an evaluation process for them to be recognized as a competent mindfulness teacher and an&nbsp;</span>opportunity&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">to promote their work. &nbsp;For the public, referrers to programs, researchers of mindfulness-based interventions and for the funding bodies who pay for them, it&nbsp;</span>means<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;that the integrity and&nbsp;</span>quality<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;of mindfulness programs can be safe-guarded.</span></p>
        <h3><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"><strong>Process</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The C</span>ertification<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;process involves the submission of video material of classes, and recordings of led practices&nbsp;and a final reflective paper.&nbsp;Assessments will be made by a national and/or international panel of senior mindfulness teachers. &nbsp;Fees paid cover the cost of the Certification process. &nbsp;Assessments will be made in part by using the <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/documents/MBI-TACMay2012.pdf">Mindfulness Based Interventions Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI TAC).</a></span></p>
        <p>As the MTIA process of assessment is based on emerging competencies, there is no set requirement of how many courses trainees will teach before applying for certification. &nbsp;We envision that between 3 and 8 rounds of MBI classes may be required for different trainees to become confident in their role and in the skills, knowledge and wisdom involved in teaching. &nbsp;This will obviously depend on various factors including levels of experience of mindfulness meditation and retreats, familiarity with movement practice as well as entry level teaching and clinical skills.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People who have already completed aspects of this training pathway (eg the eight day intensive Practicum/TDI/supervision) are invited to apply to engage in the MTIA Certification Program. Please complete the <a href="/registration-level-2" title="Apply here for Level II">LEVEL II Application</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be advised if there are any steps of the MTIA<a href="/level-i-mindfulness-foundations"> Level I </a>training pathway that you have to complete before submitting your Certification materials.</p>
        <p>MTIA will recognise certifcation by other international organisations (with equivalent standards and training pathways) and people who have been certified through these organisations can apply for recognition by the MTIA and to be listed on this website.</p>
