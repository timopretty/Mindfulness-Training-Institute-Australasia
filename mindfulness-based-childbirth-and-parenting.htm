        <h2 style="margin: 15pt 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.428571429; font-family: helvetica; color: #727272;">Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) is a childbirth education program designed to offer expectant parents the opportunity to learn the life skill of mindfulness for reducing stress during pregnancy, coping with pain and fear during childbirth and to have these skills in place for parenting mindfully from the moments of birth. A formal adaptation of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, MBCP fully integrates the teaching of mindfulness into the current knowledge of the psychobiological processes of pregnancy, the physiology of childbirth, the psychobiological needs of the infant and the individual and couple adjustment to parenting. Expectant parents report that as they practice mindfulness they are able to live through this ordinary - and extraordinary - transition in the adult life cycle with greater confidence, wisdom and joy. The practice of mindfulness becomes a lifelong resource for parenting and living with greater awareness, kindness, connectedness and care.</span></h2>

        <p style="color: #434343; font-family: tahoma; font-size: 13pt; margin: 15pt 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: helvetica; color: #727272;">As a growing body of empirical evidence from both animal and human studies indicates, stress and negative mood during pregnancy are risk factors for poor pregnancy and childbirth outcomes, a contributing factor in postpartum depression and significantly related to less than optimal parent-infant attachment. In addition, evidence continues to accumulate regarding the negative effects of prenatal and early infancy stress on the long term physical, emotional, cognitive and social development of babies and children. Stress also seems to have a significant role in setting the precursors for diabetes, heart disease, obesity, depression and addiction in adulthood. Initial preliminary research regarding MBCP seems promising, showing a significant reduction in maternal depression during pregnancy that persisted postpartum and the continued use of formal and informal mindfulness practices for self-regulation, distress tolerance and greater attunement in parenting 1 to 3 years post-course.</span></p>
