        <p>For over 2500 years Buddhist practice has utilised mindfulness as means for helping people to engage fully with life. Rather than attempting to protect ourselves from loss and pain, and withdrawing and evading painful experience through distraction, the Buddhist tradition has promoted the development of a psychology based on mindful engagement. This workshop will explore key areas of Buddhist psychology and their relevance to the practice of mindfulness in more secularised contexts. &nbsp;</p>
