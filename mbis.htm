        <h1>Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs)</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">Mark Williams once said that MBSR and MBCT are like the Pole Star, the same star seen from different hemispheres and from different views. These well-known forms of mindfulness-based programs emerged out of the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and colleagues at UMass, Worcester, USA, and were further developed by Segal, Williams and Teasdale. Since then there has been a proliferation of mindfulness-based interventions in a variety of fields, and we now have a constellation of MBI stars. &nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">It is our intention to offer a training process in which the basics of teaching eight week practice-based MBIs can be explored, examined and practiced in a way that allows us to clearer about the pedagogy involved, learn more of how they are derived from the wisdom traditions as well as from science, and cultivate a clearer awareness of what we can take away and, with care and support, usefully apply in our various professional contexts.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">Mindfulness-based programs are now being offered in diverse contexts and with diverse populations. Our aim is to prepare our trainees to teach and integrate mindfulness into the contexts and with the client populations that they are familiar with.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">We prepare our trainees to teach either or both of these programs and this pathway is also appropriate as a basic training for those who wish to teach mindfulness based approaches with specific populations such as children, adolescents, parents, substance dependence and eating disorders. The first part of the program will also be relevant to those who want an education and experience of mindfulness to inform their one-on-one clinical or coaching work.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">Established in 1979, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an eight week program generated by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the Massachusetts Medical Center for people suffering chronic and acute stress, chronic pain and illness, and associated anxiety and depression. MBSR uses a range of mindfulness practices to teach participants to cultivate an observant, accepting and compassionate stance towards their own internal experiences including cognitions, emotional states, body sensations and impulses. The research literature shows good support for the efficacy of MBSR for a wide range of problems. Many forms of mindfulness-based interventions have arisen out the MBSR program. &nbsp; Please see <a href="http://www.umassmed.edu/uploadedfiles/cfm2/training/mbsr_standards_of_practice_2014.pdf">CFM UMass MBSR Standards of Practice</a>.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt;">
        Closely based on MBSR, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) was developed by Segal, Williams and Teasdale as an intervention designed to prevent recurrences of major depression. It integrates the main elements of MBSR with some cognitive therapy components. MBCT has also broadened in its application across a range of mental health conditions, and is no longer used just in clinical contexts, but is also being offered in a range of other settings including the workplace for stress management.</p>
