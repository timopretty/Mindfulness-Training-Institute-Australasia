        <ul>
            <li>Working towards embodiment of mindfulness in terms of aliveness, sensitivity to self and others, empathic attunement, groundedness, equanimity, authenticity, curiosity and non-identification</li>
            <li>Acquiring knowledge and understanding of the structure and methods&nbsp;of mindfulness interventions&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Investigating and appreciating the different kinds of mindfulness meditation practices and their rationales</li>
            <li>Cultivating teaching skills in the areas of didactic presentations, leading practices, inquiry and group process</li>
            <li>Developing analytical and critical skills in evaluating applications of mindfulness in different contexts from both theoretical and practical perspectives</li>

            <li>Developing self-reflective capacities about personal teaching skills and knowledge including clarity about emerging levels of proficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The training pathway may be undertaken with some flexibility by students within their own time frame.  The training is divided into two stages:</p>
        <h3>LEVEL I:  Mindfulness Foundations and Development</h3>
        <p>This program offers an experiential and theoretical grounding in mindfulness for those who are working in the helping professions and are interested in incorporating mindfulness in their work as coaches, teachers, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors, researchers and group facilitators.  It will provide a solid base on which to bring secular mindfulness practice into these contexts in a way which is skillful, ethical and relevant. (It will also provide a strong base for those wishing to go on to Level II of the program). &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some of the prerequisites for the Level I training are: &nbsp;</p>
