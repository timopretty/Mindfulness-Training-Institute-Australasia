<p>What does it mean</p>
<p>to listen to a voice before it is spoken?</p>
<p>It means making space for the other,</p>
<p>being aware of the other,</p>
<p>paying attention to the other.</p>

<h1>The Art and Practice of Inquiry</h1>
<p>Inquiry could be seen as the heart of the MBSR/CT process, and one that is most challenging for new teachers to feel at ease with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This two day training workshop is for people who are already teaching MBSR, MBCT or a related program (or are planning to do so) and who want to explore leading and inquiry in a way that we hope is effective, salient and empowering. We are offering this workshop &nbsp;to those who have already completed the Intensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will explore "inquiry" as an ordinary conversation that we might have within our own practice, with our own meditation teachers, and that we can bring forth and facilitate in a spirit of genuine curiosity in our mindfulness groups.&nbsp;We will practice together and inquire into our practice, and then explore issues of timing, language, levels of engagement, group process, empathic resonance and depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some specific explorations might be:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>How to help people engage in the daily practice (when they are too tired, busy, or anxious to name few!)?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How to help people make sense of their experiences, and cultivate a sense of curiosity and openness?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Is there a difference between "therapy" and "mindfulness" in the inquiry process?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How can I quickly help someone regulate their emotional arousal so they can feel safe and motivated to practice?</p>
    </li>
