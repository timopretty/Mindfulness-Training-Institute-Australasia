        <h1>Level I: Prerequisites</h1>
		<h2>Pre-requisites that need to be completed BEFORE applying for the Level I training include:</h2>
		<h3>Participating in an eight week MBSR or MBCT course.</h3>
		<p>Personally experiencing the way mindfulness is taught in MBSR or MBCT is an important part in your preparation to become a teacher yourself. You will probably be able to find an MBSR or MBCT course in your local area by doing an internet search. Please make sure the teacher of the course has done sufficient training in MBSR or MBCT themselves and is experienced in teaching. Please check with us if you're not sure if a course you found would be suitable.</p>
		<p><strong>NB:</strong> <em>The online MBSR course through Sounds True does </em> <strong><em><u>not </u></em></strong> <em>meet the pre-requisites because there is no direct contact with a teacher.</em></p>
		<h3>Regular mindfulness meditation practice</h3>
		<p>Engaging regularly in a personal mindfulness meditation practice (ie. a sustained practice of at least 12 months) is a central part of preparing for Level I training.</p>
		<h3>Attending a 5 - 7 day silent mindfulness meditation retreat</h3>
		<p>Attending <a href="/silent-retreats">silent retreats</a> are a central part of offering mindfulness to others and an ongoing source of professional and personal nourishment and inquiry for mindfulness teachers. Initially we ask that you undertake at least one silent, teacher-led mindfulness meditation retreat of at least 5 days as a pre-requisite for the Intensive. This immersion in the practice makes it possible to engage skillfully with the kinds of dilemmas and questions that arise in people's practice. It also develops our own personal qualities of acceptance, patience, trust, non-striving, letting be and stability of mind. Most mindfulness approaches are drawn from the tradition of Insight (Vipassana ) meditation, and insight meditation retreats are widely available in Australia. Even though you may have completed retreats in other contemplative traditions we ask you to complete a <a href="/silent-retreats">silent <em>mindfulness meditation</em> retreat</a> as part of this training process.</p>
		<p><strong>We do not run silent retreats ourselves, but </strong> <a href="/silent-retreats"><strong>click here</strong></a> <strong><u> </u></strong> <strong>to go to a listing of various organisations who do.</strong></p>
		<h3>Cultivating a body-based practice</h3>
		<p>Awareness of the body is central in teaching mindfulness meditation. In-depth experience in a body-based awareness and movement practice can assist bringing awareness into everyday life and bring confidence into the teaching of body-focussed practices. Regularly attending Hatha yoga classes is ideal as this is the form of movement practice that is taught in MBSR/CT, but other awareness-based training can be helpful eg. T'ai Chi, Feldenkrais, Chi Gung.</p>
		<h3>Professional background</h3>
		<p>Having a professional background which involves working with people (in a clinical, educational or communications area) provides important ground for the teaching work.</p>
		<h3>Requisite relational skills</h3>
		<p>Teaching MBSR and MBCT involves personal and interpersonal qualities such as genuineness, compassion, warmth, empathy and potency.</p>
		<p><strong>Applications will only be accepted from those who have completed <em>all</em> the above pre-requisites.</strong></p>
