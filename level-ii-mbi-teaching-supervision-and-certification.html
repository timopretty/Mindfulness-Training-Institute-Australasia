		<h2>It involves:</h2>
		<h3>Application interview to proceed to Level II</h3>
		<p>This interview is a joint exploration of where you are at in terms of beginning teaching and what support and you might need. Topics will include: supervision arrangements, use of the MBI TAC in supervision, retreats and any other matters which seem important arising out of the Level I program.</p>
		<p>Out of this discussion, you may be asked to take more time for integration of their own practice and understanding through reading, retreats, teachings and other training before proceeding to the challenges of Level II study.</p>
		<h3>Study Module II</h3>
		<p>An integrative writing project to explore the MBI pedagogy drawing on practice, training, supervision and teaching experience.</p>
		<h3>Attending Teacher Development Retreats</h3>
		<p>Once you have completed Level 1, you are welcome to join other trainees in Teacher Development Retreats. This are held annually and are an opportunity to further develop and hone your teaching skills and knowledge, as well as developing a more secure, grounded relationship with yourself in teaching. We intend the TDRs to contribute to an ongoing emergence of integration in our bodies, hearts and minds through practice, teaching, reflection and investigation.</p>
		<h3>Ongoing silent retreats (6 - 10 days)</h3>
		<p>Ongoing annual silent retreats to deepen and enrich understanding and embodiment of the practice</p>
		<h3>Teaching either MBSR or MBCT eight week courses</h3>
		<p>There is no set requirement of how many courses you will teach before applying for certification. We envision that between 3 and 8 rounds of MBI classes	may be required for different trainees to become confident in their role and in the skills, knowledge and wisdom involved in teaching. This will obviously depend on various factors including your level of experience of mindfulness meditation and retreats, familiarity with movement practice as well as entry-level teaching and clinical skills. In some cases, additional supervision hours or trainings on relevant teaching-related skills may be included in your supervision plan.</p>
		<h3>Supervision of teaching work (minimum of 8 hours)</h3>
		<p>Supervision provides an opportunity for you to get support and guidance with a supervisor and fellow trainees as they begin to teach your first courses. The process fosters precision and comprehensiveness in the teaching of mindfulness groups, and encourages an authentic exploration of unexamined habits and patterns that hinder effectiveness in teaching and living. Supervision is about creating a space which is dedicated to investigating, understanding and honing teaching skills, including assessment, group process, leading practices, didactic presentations and inquiry as well as curriculum and class structure. Regular supervision - whether with a more senior teacher or in peer groups - is encouraged throughout one's teaching career.</p>
		<p>This in-depth process of support, guidance, exploratory dialogue and precise feedback will offer you the self-review skills and clarity about your own level of proficiency, which you can take forward as part of your life long learning as mindfulness teachers. The development of the following competencies based on the MBI-TAC will be supported:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Coverage, pacing and organization of session curriculum</li>
			<li>Relational skills</li>
			<li>Embodiment of mindfulness</li>
			<li>Guiding mindfulness practices</li>
			<li>Conveying course themes through interactive inquiry and didactic teaching</li>
			<li>Management of group learning environment</li>
		</ol>	
		<p>At a minimum, you will complete 8 hours of supervision (pro-rata) in a group or individual supervision context. Supervision can be conducted by phone, Skype or in person. In supervision you may use some or all of the following to communicate their classroom experience with the supervision group:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>process notes</li>
			<li>audio recordings*</li>
			<li>video recordings*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>MTIA is not able to accommodate trainee placements in a teaching setting. You will be required to establish your own classes to build competencies in offering the program. We ask that you agree not to teach MBSR or MBCT without appropriate supervision while enrolled in the MTIA program. Level II trainees will be encouraged to list their courses on the MTIA trainee courses web page, which will be established soon.

		<h3>Certification</h3>
		<p><a href="/certification">Certification</a> provides an evaluation process for you to be recognised by the Institute as a competent mindfulness teacher. It involves the submission of video material of classes, and recordings of led practices and a final reflective paper which outlines your learning and development through the teaching/supervision process and ongoing practice. Fees paid cover the cost of the assessment process. Assessments will be made by a national and/or international panel of senior teachers using the <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/documents/MBI-TACMay2012.pdf">Mindfulness Based Interventions Teacher Assessment of Competence (MBI-TAC)</a> developed in the UK.</p>
		<p>People who have already completed aspects of this training pathway (eg the eight day intensive "practicum"/TDI/supervision) are invited to apply to engage in the MTIA Certification Program. Please use the online <a href="/applications">Level II Application</a> form. You will be advised if there are any steps of the MTIA training pathway that you have to complete before submitting your Certification materials.</p>
		<p>For an annual fee, certified teachers will be invited to be listed on the MTIA website with a link to their website, and to join the certified teacher's	web based group to access information, share issues and questions and participate in ongoing learning. Teachers will furnish the MTIA with an annual summary of their teaching engagements and professional development. MTIA is open to recognising certification by other organisations and people who have been certified through these organisations can apply for recognition by the MTIA and to be listed on the website.</p>
