<p>We are very much looking forward to meeting with you for the MBI Supervisor Training weekend in May. Here are some suggestions for preparation for our time together, as well as some logistical information.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Pre-reading:</strong><br>
<p>It is important for the learning process that you read the following article (attached in this email) in preparation for the weekend, as well as familiarising yourself with the MBI TAC (link below)</p>
<ul>
    <li>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">MBI TAC exploration: Videos of your mindfulness teaching</span></strong></p>
<p>Ideally we would use videos of external teachers in order to discuss various teaching points&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">but have been unable to source these so we have a request.</span></p>
<p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">We ask that those of you who are willing, to bring along a couple of excerpts from your recent recording of a class &ndash; perhaps one which demonstrates something that went well, and maybe one which you feel did not go so well.</span><span class="" style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">We ask that it be of an inquiry, didactic or group process moment, rather than simply leading practices.</span><span class="" style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">There is no pressure to present your own work if this doesn&rsquo;t feel right for you.</span><span class="" style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">If you are happy to do this, please bring your recording on a USB.</span></p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><strong>Sitting Equipment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Some mats and sitting equipment will be provided but do you bring your own if it is easy to do so.</span></p>
