<p>Hello&nbsp;{tag_recipientfirstname},</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your application for Level II of the MTIA pathway to certification as a mindfulness teacher.</p>
<p>I would like to &ldquo;meet&rdquo; with you on the phone sometime soon, to discuss where you are at in terms of your development and direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have some flexibility on Wednesday afternoons for this phone meeting &ndash; beginning Wednesday 21<sup>st</sup> from 3pm.&nbsp; I am happy to call you on the number that you have provided.</p>
<p>Do let me know if this will work for you, or if this is impossible, do be in touch and we will work out a time that suits you and I will try to accommodate.</p>
<p>Before we meet, it would be good if you could have a look at the MBI TAC <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/documents/MBI-TACMay2012.pdf">http://www.bangor.ac.uk/mindfulness/documents/MBI-TACMay2012.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is the tool we will be using for self-reflection and evaluation in the certification process.&nbsp; We hope that it will open up areas of development and also be affirming of your process too.</p>
<p>I look forward to connecting with you. </p>
