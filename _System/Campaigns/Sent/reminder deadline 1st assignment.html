<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Hm, I almost got that email out right, just forgot to change the subject heading from default 'May Newsletter' into the above..</em></p>
<p>Just a reminder that the deadline for submission of the first assignment for the Study Module is this Friday 30th May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few people have asked about formatting requirements: there are no specific formatting requirements, just pick an easy to read font (not in italics), no smaller than 12 in size, with normal spacing. There is no need for double line spacing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be handy if you could include a cover page with your name and email address is the first page of your paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best with the last bits!</p>
