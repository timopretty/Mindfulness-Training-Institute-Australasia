<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few people have reminded me we also promised to send the contact list of participants in the Intensive, so here it is (below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be discrete and respectful with this list. E.g. don't just load the details in your marketing email list and start sending people annoying emails about the latest wonderfully soft soap your neighbor is selling (or something)!</p>
<p>{module_literature,i,124659} (NB in some of the mobile numbers the 0 is missing in front of the 4; a fun feature of Excel that I cant do anything about.)</p>
<p>Maura also asked me to send you a few more poems on her behalf :{module_literature,i,124660}</p>
<p>Kindly,&nbsp;</p>
