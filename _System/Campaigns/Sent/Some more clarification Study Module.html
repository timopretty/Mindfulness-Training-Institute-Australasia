<p>Dear MTIA Students,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p><span>We are very aware that you are our precious first cohort through the Level 1 of our training pathway, and thus are having to absorb some of our learning errors. Some things that seemed wise at a planning weekend some months ago are being called into question as we roll things out in practice &ndash; and this is especially so around the Study Module.</span></p>
<p>Just reiterating a few things already emailed to you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have learned that a 2000 word limit is not enough to meaningfully answer the questions so have increased the word limit to 3,500 words. This means that Nique is now marking longer essays so we are paying her more.</li>
    <li>We could see that certain essay questions make more sense before the intensive and some after, and some are better embedded in the Level 2 training. Hence we are reorganising the study module essays to reflect this.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>We also realised it was better to have more specific reading lists for each essay and have now amended this, with relevant articles being linked on the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have already completed, or nearly completed, the originally listed second essay (which in future will be part of Level 2), we will accept this one for Nique to mark.</p>
<p>If you do not want to proceed to Level 2, we will refund you the cost of the third essay ($125). If you do proceed to Level 2, you can do the third essay then, but the cost has already been covered in the $385 you originally paid.</p>
<p>Please get in touch with Astrid if you already know you will <strong>not</strong> proceed onto Level II and would like the $125 refund.</p>
<p>In future cohorts, the Level 1 Study Module will cost approximately $280 for 2 x 3,500 word essays, and the Level 2 Study Module will cost approximately $140 for 1 x 3,500 word essay.</p>
<p>We are also reviewing the way that fees are charged as we can see this is hard to administer from your end and from Astrid&rsquo;s. As we have now come to the end of our first financial year, we will be in a better position to determine fair fees and more manageable ways of paying them. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Again, please accept our apologies as we iron out these glitches.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Warm regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Maura and Tim, </span></p>
<p><span>Directors of Training</span></p>
</p>
