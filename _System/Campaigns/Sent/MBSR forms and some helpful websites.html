<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few people have asked for examples of intake and feedback forms for an MBSR or MBCT course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For MBCT, these are all in the book that is part of the required reading for the Study module.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For MBSR, Tim is happy to provide an example of the forms that Openground uses:&nbsp;{module_literature,c,22540}</p>
<p>Tienne also sent me links to two very useful websites (thanks again, Tienne!).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first is a website where you can download free pdf files of a wide range of books, for free:&nbsp;<a href="www.pdfbook.co.ke">www.pdfbook.co.ke</a>&nbsp;. You
    can subscribe for free for 1 month and download the most wonderful selection of
    mindfulness (and other) texts.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The other is to a blog you can subscribe to to stay up to date with the latest research (and other relevant events) about meditation, follow this link and scroll down the page, great stuff:&nbsp;<a href="http://http://meditation-research.org.uk/category/research-blog/" target="_blank">www.meditation-research.org.uk/category/research-blog/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Warmly,&nbsp;</p>
