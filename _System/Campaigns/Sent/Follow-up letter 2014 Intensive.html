<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;"><b>1. Essays for completing Level I</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;" dir="ltr"><em>i. New word limit</em> </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;">We have had some good feedback from you that the 2000 word limit does not offer enough space for some of you to discuss the questions in a satisfying way.&nbsp; To this end, each essay has an optional extended word limit so that the submitted word count can be from 2000 -3500 words (max).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;"><em>ii. Study Module Change</em></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;">We have also done a review of the Study Module and have a change we think will work better.&nbsp;&nbsp; From now on, Level I will just have two essays and both need to be completed before you engage in teaching MBSR/CT as a Level II trainee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be sending you a specific list of readings for the second essay soon.&nbsp; (The third and final essay will become part of the Level 2 certification process.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic of the second essay and required readings will be sent to you on Friday. The deadline for submitting the second essay is 30<sup>th</sup> September 2014. </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;"><i>iii.&nbsp;Guidelines for essays </i></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;">One of the important bases of teaching MBIs is the integration of personal experiential knowing and the theoretical and cognitive aspects of our knowing. To this end, we ask that you really engage in a rigorous way with the textbooks and articles as resources, and to use Harvard referencing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And also that you bring to the discussion your own understandings and experience of the theory you are exploring.&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that this takes work and is an art in itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 2cm;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>2. Continuing on to Level II</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">As we discussed at the training, if you wish to move to Level II you can enrol online.&nbsp; We will arrange an interview on the phone or Skype, to discuss your plans, to celebrate what is strong in you already, and to helpfully consider areas where you feel you need to develop in order to teach well. We will discuss how you might do this in terms of supervision, reading, retreats, etc. Level II trainees will get significant discounts for workshops and Alumni retreat fees. You do need to have completed the 2 essays to enrol in the Level II training. </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>3. Further Directions if not enrolling in Level II</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">If you do not wish to formally move on to Level II, then you can still arrange an interview time to discuss your progress and supervision requirements for your next stage of development. Please be in touch with Astrid about how to go about this.&nbsp; A $65 fee will be charged to cover admin time and the interview.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt;"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>4. Practicing leading practices</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Some of you may have found out that you didn&rsquo;t have enough familiarity with leading some of the practices as is needed to teach the course, and that it was difficult to lead from your own experience in the moment.&nbsp; This is a capacity that comes from practice.&nbsp; Some ways that will help with this are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>taking an MBI course again and really doing all the practices with the CDs</li>
    <li>listening to the CDs over an 8 week period by yourself with attention to the leading, attending to the intentions and language</li>
    <li>leading yourself in a practice, recording it, and then using that recording to practice from so you can be a recipient of your own leading</li>
    <li>reading the excellent MBCT text book by Teasdale, Williams and Segal (on the reading list) where all the practices are written out in full.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body based practice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you do not and have never had an immersion (of weekly practice) in a body based discipline like yoga etc, then it may well be an important part of personal training that you need to take up to become familiar with the practice, so that you can lead practice with some confidence and also have some sense of how to guide others.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>5. Insurance for teaching MBIs</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Some of you have been interested in finding out about insurance for teaching MBIs as part of the Level II process if you are not already covered by your existing professional indemnity.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are in the process of researching the best way to go about this and will be in touch soon about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>6. Supervision</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Supervision is a central aspect of the training pathway, rather than a luxury. Different people will require more supervision than others.&nbsp; Doing supervision in a small group is a great way to economise on cost, to develop future peer supervision relationships, and to hear and reflect on each other&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Here is an article about the supervision process and what you might expect from it: {module_literature,i,124123}&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>7.</b> <b>Inquiry Workshop</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Inquiry and weaving in the didactic elements of the program is a central aspect of the course and is often the thing teachers find most challenging.&nbsp; We will be offering an inquiry workshop later in the year to facilitate more practice and reflection on it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;"><b>8. Alumni Intensives</b></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">Next year we will be offering a 4 - 5 day Alumni Intensive for all Level II trainees. These will have a similar structure as the Level 1 Intensive, and will be an opportunity to reconnect, practice and reflect together.&nbsp; Various topics can be offered as part of the Alumni Intensive including: inquiry, practicing the didactic elements of the programs, safety in mindful movement and finding your natural voice.&nbsp; We will be in touch soon with the details.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 18pt;">&nbsp;</p>
