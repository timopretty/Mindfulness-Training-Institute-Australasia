Dear&nbsp;{tag_recipientfirstname},
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We hope you have been getting into some reading and reflecting for your first assignment for the Study Module. And have hopefully found that inspiring! We've posted a few articles in the Secure Zone on the website that we think will be helpful with that first assignment.&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Here are your login details for the Secure Zone (accessible through the homepage <a href="http://www.mtia.net.au/" target="_blank" title="Click here to go MTIA homepage">www.mtia.net.au</a>):&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">Username:&nbsp;{tag_recipientusername}</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">Password:&nbsp;M9P6VQkR</blockquote>
<p>After you have logged in once, you can change your password by clicking on 'Lost password?' underneath the login box.&nbsp;</p>
<div>There is also a Student Forum in the secure zone, where you can interact with other students.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The forum is still empty now, so feel free to start making some noise there!</div>
<br>
<div>And please do let us know if you are encountering any technical difficulties with the website or the secure zone; not everything in the new website is set up properly yet.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Learning to operate our very sophisticated new website is a bit like when I got my first smartphone: great convenience and functionality once I started to get the hang of it, but initially majorly mind boggling to&nbsp;get even the simplest things done!</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Kindly,&nbsp;</div>
