<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Dear {tag_recipientfirstname},</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">In December, we sent you an invite to register your interest for a training weekend MBI Supervision, to be held on the weekend of 22 - 24th May.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Just in case you did not get that email, or you were still thinking about it: this workshop is definitely going ahead, with 18 senior teachers like yourself already having registered their interest. There also are still a few spaces available, so if you do want to participate, you can still register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">More info and registration can be found on this webpage:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mtia.org.au/Supervision-and-MBI-TAC-Workshop" target="_blank">http://www.mtia.org.au/Supervision-and-MBI-TAC-Workshop</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Please note this workshop is by invite only!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Warmly,&nbsp;</span></p>
