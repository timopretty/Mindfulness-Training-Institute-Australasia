<p>Dear&nbsp;{tag_recipientfirstname},</p>
<p>Thank you for your application for the MTIA Level II training which you submitted a while ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This email is to let you know we did receive your application and that we will be in touch next week to schedule a time and day for a brief interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our apologies if it has taken a while to get back to you; operating our new website is not going as smoothly yet as we would have liked!</p>
<p>Could you please confirm that you have received this email? Thanks!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Kindly,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
