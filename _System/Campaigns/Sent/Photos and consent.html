<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to gather some (more) photo's from the Intensive, to collate into something visual to help us all remember the special time we spent together in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are two group photo's, thanks Sharada and Dyan. They both sent some lovely other photo's as well, and it made me wonder if anyone else had any good photo's from the Intensive? For example, I remember seeing one with the borderline/psychotic cat doing a lovely yoga stretch on it's back in the sun on the grass, next to Ele, I believe..</p>
<p><strong>Consent: </strong>we briefly discussed this during the Intensive and I recall Gesa and Lisa saying that they did not want any 'close-up' photo's featuring them specifically used for general purposes (i.e. on our website), but were okay with being in a large group photo as below. Lisa, Gesa, could you both confirm if I remember that correctly? And do your objections extend to photo';s being circulated among other people who attended the Intensive?</p>
<p>And could anyone else who has objections to photo's with them in it being used on the website or circulated among other participants of this year's Intensive?</p>
<p>Thanks! Astrid</p>
