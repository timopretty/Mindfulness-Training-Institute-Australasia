<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you had not found a good article yet about the use of mindfulness in the management of chronic pain for your 2nd essay, just sending a link to an article by Craig Hassed. He wrote it for Australian Family Physician, a journal for GP's, with handy links to abstracts of all the references:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2013/march/mind-body-therapies/" target="_blank">click to go to article</a></p>
<p>All the best with the essay!</p>
