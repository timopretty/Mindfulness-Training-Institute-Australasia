<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Hi everyone,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Over the next few days, my role as coordinator/administrator of MTIA will be taken over by someone else. I am wanting to free up more time and energy for my mindfulness teaching, psychotherapy work and studies. I have felt privileged to have been part of the start of MTIA and will still be involved with MTIA in other ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">My role will be taken over by Caroline Friend. The email address (info@mtia.org.au) and mobile number (0435 049 383) for MTIA will still be the same. I will be available initially in the background to support Caroline to answer any questions, particularly those relating to prior arrangements, conversations etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Please note that the job of coordinator/administrator is only a part time one, so Caroline may not be able to answer emails and phone calls instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Also, Caroline is not a mindfulness teacher herself, but has more strengths in a administrative and organizing role. Any questions that require more in-depth understanding of mindfulness teaching or the training process at MTIA will be passed on by Caroline to Timothea Goddard, one of our Directors of Training.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">I wish
you all the best with your evolving mindfulness teaching, and I will likely meet
some of you at a workshop or retreat! </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">I am
confident you will all be in good hands with Caroline, and please be in touch if
this email raises and questions or concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Warmly,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Verdana;">Astrid de Ruiter</span></p>
