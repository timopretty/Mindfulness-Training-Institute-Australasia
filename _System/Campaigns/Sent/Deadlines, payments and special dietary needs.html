<p>Dear{tag_recipientfirstname},</p>
<p>I received a few inquiries about these matters, so I thought I'd clarify this for everyone:&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<h3>ASSIGNMENT DEADLINE:&nbsp;</h3>
</strong>
<div><strong>The deadline for submissions the first assignment is May 30th.&nbsp;</strong>Do contact us if you have questions about the assignment or marking criteria.&nbsp;
<div><strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong>
<h3>PAYMENTS:</h3>
</strong></div>
<strong>Payment of the fee for the Intensive (AU$2,695) is due by 15th May.</strong> We are trying to get the PayPal function on our website going by then, so you can pay by credit card if you want. We will also give the option to pay by direct debit. We will notify you beforehand again of the payment being due.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Some of you have not paid yet for the Study Module ($385);</strong> the invoice for that was attached to the email with the Overview for the 2014 Study Module. Do let me know if you can't find the invoice. I'm still plowing through all the payments made so far manually, and will be sending out receipts to those of you who have paid over the next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><strong>When making a payment,</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">please please please</span></strong><em> </em>always include either your surname or the invoice number in the reference field of the internet banking payment. Otherwise there is no way for me to identify who made the payment. If you are paying by money order or similar, please put your mobile phone number down as a reference. Thanks!</div>

<h3><strong>SPECIAL DIETARY NEEDS</strong></h3>
The caterer of Hartzer Park, where we will be having the July Intensive, is into some serious forward planning, and wants to know about everyone's special dietary needs as soon as possible. I know this question was also on the application form, but not everyone fills that in and some of you have applied a long time ago, so things may have changed in the meantime. &nbsp;
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>So if you have special dietary needs, other than vegetarian, please let me know asap.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Okay, that's it for now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Warmly,&nbsp;</p>
