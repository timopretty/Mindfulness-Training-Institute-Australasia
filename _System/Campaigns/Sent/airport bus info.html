<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those of you who have booked a place on the bus from Sydney airport to the retreat centre:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Please <strong>turn on your mobile phone</strong> as soon as you've gotten off your plane, so you can be reached&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>meeting point</strong> is at luggage carousel 1 in Terminal 3 (Quantas terminal) of the Domestic airport. Anyone hanging around that area with a yoga mat strapped to their luggage is a likely fellow trainee...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Please start to <strong>gather at this meeting point at 10:45 am if possible.</strong> We'd like the bus to leave at about 11:00 am, but there is some flexibility, so please don's stress if you are running a little late. The bus won't leave until everyone is there, unless it's clear your flight has a major delay or we can't get any contact with you. The bus will then go on to the International terminal to pick up a few people travelling from New Zealand.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you have a problem getting to the meeting point in time (e.g. you've missed your flight or your flight has been majorly delayed), please ring or text me on either of these &nbsp;numbers: Astrid: 0435 049 383 or 0401 624 757</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WANTED: a bus-contact person:</strong></p>
<p>We will already be at the retreat center on the Sunday morning to prepare, so we need someone who'd be okay to be contact person for the bus driver. Your task would be to help him make sure everyone who needs to be on the bus is there. We would of course provide with all necessary info and be available by phone as a back-up source of help and info if there are any problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who would be willing to take on this important little task?</strong> Please email or phone me, thanks!</p>
