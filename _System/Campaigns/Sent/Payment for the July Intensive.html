<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payments for the July Intensive are due by 15th May, but we still don't have our PayPal function up and running; our website people are very overloaded at the moment, so work progress with them has been slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you would prefer to pay by credit card (via PayPal)</strong>, please bear with us for a little while longer and we'll let you know when you can do that through our website. Sorry, you can't pay by credit card on the phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are fine to pay by direct debit,</strong> please do so within the next few days. I will email you a tax receipt once I have processed your payment. If you would like me to send you an invoice first before making payment, do let me know.</p>
<p>The fee for the Intensive is $2,695, below are the internet banking details.&nbsp;</p>
