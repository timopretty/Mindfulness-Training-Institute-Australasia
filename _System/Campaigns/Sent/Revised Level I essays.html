<div>Dear {tag_recipientfirstname},</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>After assessing the first batch of essays for the Level I Study Module and also after getting some feedback from students, we have decided to make some changes to the Study Module. They are listed below.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><strong>i. New word limit&nbsp;</strong><br>
</div>
<div>
We have had some good feedback that the 2000 word limit does not offer enough space for some of you to discuss the questions in a satisfying way. &nbsp;To this end, each essay has an optional extended word limit so that the submitted word count can be from 2000 -3500 words (max).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>
ii. Study Module Change</strong><br>
We have also done a review of the essay topics and have a change we think will work better. From now on, Level I will just have two essays and both need to be completed before you engage in teaching MBSR/CT as a Level II trainee. &nbsp; The third and final essay will become part of the Level 2 certification process.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>The topic of the second essay has been changed, </strong>and we've decided to provide more focused suggestions for book chapters and articles for the first essay.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We have changed the lists of suggested readings in the listing in the secure zone of our website.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Please have a good look at this revised version of instructions and reading for the first two essays, it also includes some short examples of the kind of answers we are looking for.<br>

<br>
<strong>iii. Guidelines for essays</strong>&nbsp;<br>
One of the important bases of teaching MBIs is the integration of personal experiential knowing and the theoretical and cognitive aspects of our knowing. To this end, we ask that you really engage in a rigorous way with the textbooks and articles as resources, and to use Harvard referencing. And also that you bring to the discussion your own understandings and experience of the theory you are exploring. We recognise that balancing and integrating both these aspect takes work and is an art in itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</div>
<div>If you have been reading and using some of the 'old' articles, please don't worry and just include it in your essay. Quite a few of those are now recommended reading for the 2nd essay, so your work is not for nothing!<br>
</div>
<div><strong><br>
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Could you please be in touch with us to let us know how you are going with your first essay, and also if you have any questions regarding the below? Thanks!</strong><br>
</div>

</div>
<div>Warmly,&nbsp;</div>
