<p>Dear {tag_recipientfirstname},</p>
<p>A few people have asked about this, so we thought we'd clarify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the version of the Guidelines sent out to you, and which you'd all signed, the last paragraph on the bottom of page 2 reads:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'MTIA students agree not to teach mindfulness-based interventions without appropriate supervision while enrolled in the MTIA program'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few people have pointed out they are already using mindfulness in (individual) sessions with clients, or are running mindfulness meditation practice groups. This is of course fine, the intention of the statement is to discourage people from starting to teach MBSR or MBCT group courses without appropriate supervision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So an amended version of this paragraph is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'MTIA students agree not to teach Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ((MBSR) or Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) without appropriate supervision while enrolled in the MTIA program'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that clarifies things, and no, you don't need to sign for that separately again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Astrid de Ruiter</p>
<p>MTIA program coordinator</p>
