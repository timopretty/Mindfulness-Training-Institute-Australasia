<div>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Please find here the revised info for the 2nd essay:&nbsp;{module_literature,i,124653}</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>My apologies for sending this a few days later than announced, it was a bit more fidgety than I thought to change the reading list on the website (of course...One day I'll learn to make more realistic estimates of how long things will take!).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>You can download all the articles listed in the document with the 2nd essay from the secure zone of our website; you'll notice (with some delight, I hope), that some of them are the same as for the first essay.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For those of you who still need to complete the first essay, the document also contains some more focused suggestions for reading for the first essay.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For those of you who had already started on the 'old' 2nd essay, we do apologize for any inconvenience. We do think this new topic (which is a rework of what was originally the 3rd essay) will be much more helpful in preparing to start teaching.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Below are again the comments about the essay from our email from last week.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);">Please be aware that the deadline for this new 2nd essay is 30th September 2014.&nbsp;</span></strong></div>

<div>Warmly,&nbsp;</div>

1. Essays for completing Level I<br>
i. New word limit&nbsp;<br>
We have had some good feedback from you that the 2000 word limit does not offer enough space for some of you to discuss the questions in a satisfying way. &nbsp;To this end, each essay has an optional extended word limit so that the submitted word count can be from 2000 -3500 words (max).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
ii. Study Module Change<br>
We have also done a review of the Study Module and have a change we think will work better. &nbsp; From now on, Level I will just have two essays and both need to be completed before you engage in teaching MBSR/CT as a Level II trainee. &nbsp; &nbsp;We will be sending you a specific list of readings for the second essay soon. &nbsp;(The third and final essay will become part of the Level 2 certification process.) &nbsp;The topic of the second essay and required readings will be sent to you on Friday. The deadline for submitting the second essay is 30th September 2014.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
iii. Guidelines for essays&nbsp;<br>
One of the important bases of teaching MBIs is the integration of personal experiential knowing and the theoretical and cognitive aspects of our knowing. To this end, we ask that you really engage in a rigorous way with the textbooks and articles as resources, and to use Harvard referencing. &nbsp; And also that you bring to the discussion your own understandings and experience of the theory you are exploring. We recognise that this takes work and is an art in itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>
