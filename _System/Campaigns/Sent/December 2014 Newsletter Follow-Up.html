<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">MTIA&rsquo;s inaugural Level I Intensive went really well this year, with students coming from all over Australia and New Zealand. The next Level I Intensive will be held from 17<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 24<sup>th</sup> August 2015, and is already filling up fast.&nbsp; Here are some photos and comments from students from this year.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>"This was my second intensive training in the MBSR program. This is a well thought out, insightful, clear, professional and educational training. I was moved, challenged, inspired and provided with a safe and spacious holding to watch it all unfold. Blessings to all the teachers and participants for their integrity and sharing of their knowledge and humanity with us all." &nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;- Jenn Apps (Melbourne)</span></span></p>

I deeply valued the opportunity to join together with the teachers and the other students in the pursuit of further developing our skills and experience of leading the MBSR course components. On completion of the week I felt inspired and ready to commit to teaching the course. I'm entering level 2 of the training program and will be leading my first MBSR course, with the support of supervision, at the beginning of 2015. The intensive consolidated my sense of readiness to start teaching and I would highly recommend it." &nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;- Kate Skilbeck (Melbourne)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>"The MBSR teacher training was not only an inspirational and well run course that allowed me to learn the ins-and-outs of the MBSR&nbsp; program, it was also personally transformative and life affirming. The MTIA team are both professional and also wonderfully warm hearted and supportive. I highly recommend this training." &nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-size: 12px;">- Alana Gregory (Adelaide)</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(32, 88, 103);">Recent Research News: &nbsp;the need for home practice?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;"><img src="/images/man meditating on chair in office_cropped.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; width: 250px; height: 352px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">There have been a number of papers over the years that have investigated&nbsp;whether&nbsp;home practice is related to beneficial outcomes including whether there is a dose (ie time spent in formal practice)-response effect. More recent papers have examined whether home practice in MBCT impacts specifically on reducing depression relapses. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">In early 2104, the UK Oxford and Bangor Centres published a joint research project comparing 2 types of MBCT courses &ndash; the standard one, and one in which the class and home meditation practices&nbsp;were removed completely.&nbsp; Their results&nbsp;suggested that the meditation practice made no difference to depression outcomes unless you had a history of childhood adversity. Essentially this said that for those without childhood trauma of any kind, just knowing about mindfulness and self-care was enough to protect against relapse but if there was a history of childhood trauma, then the meditation practice&nbsp;facilitated a fuller effect (Crane et al, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 2014). This has caused much debate as it seems to contradict most meditation teachers&rsquo; personal experience and clinical experience.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">However, two other recent studies have shed further light (Crane et al, BRAT 2014; Perich et al, BRAT 2013). Crane&rsquo;s study shows that there is a clear association between the amount of practice done and the benefits people notice. If people meditate less than 3 days per week, no benefits are found on depression outcomes. The Perich study is an Australian one and was looking at MBCT for Bipolar Disorder but again noted that the frequency of manic episodes, anxiety and depression were all improved in those who meditated 3 days a week or more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">Clearly ongoing research is needed to help us understand these findings and how mindfulness courses are working!</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">This is an invitation to all of you who completed the MTIA Level I Intensive or other equivalent professional teacher training in the MBIs &nbsp;(perhaps through Openground, CTAD, Monash or the CFM) over the last few years.&nbsp; We welcome you to five days of exploration, learning and communing with MBI colleagues at the beautiful Sangsurya Retreat Centre in Byron Bay. This is a lovely bush setting with ocean views and very comfortable accommodation and wonderful food. You are welcome to come and immerse yourself in this training whether or not you have begun formally teaching MBSR or MBCT.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">As well as exploring and deepening our personal mindfulness practice, the Alumni Intensive will have the focus of exploring the rich dance in the MBI classes of communicating course themes through embodiment, didactic teaching and the inquiry process. We will explore this through teaching and inquiring in small groups, examining and practicing different elements of the programs. All of this will be supported by reflection, connecting to the philosophical and theoretical roots of this work and our practice together.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">MTIA is part of a global network of teacher training organisations which is working towards international agreement on mindfulness teacher training pathways, standards and certification protocols so that the standard of MBI teaching can be fostered and maintained.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana;">In April of 2014, Timothea attended meetings at the Center for Mindfulness, UMass, and in October this year, Maura visited each of the 3 most established mindfulness training centres in the UK &nbsp;(Bangor, Oxford and Exeter) to foster ongoing relationships, explore their training pathways and collaborate on the model we are developing here in Australia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">The UK centres have been instrumental in the setting up of this international network of training organisations, framing the questions and considerations, and organising the meetings.&nbsp; The Directors of MTIA will be attending a meeting in July of 2015 in Chester, UK to further develop the network framework.&nbsp; We are currently meeting with colleagues who are already running Mindfulness teacher training organisation in Hong Kong and Korea to look at establishing an Asia Pacific Network.</span><strong><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
