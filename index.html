        <div>
        <p>Over the past 30 years there has been an explosion of interest in the use of mindfulness interventions in the fields of health, education, business and community development.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dangers and possibilities inherent in this rapid spread of mindfulness-based interventions into a wide variety of secular settings. &nbsp; The benefits include the possibility of people in mainstream settings getting access to a tradition of practice that invites an understanding of one's interior world, to train one's minds in a useful direction, and to thereby radically transform one's relationship to oneself, one's problems and life - in ways which are liberating. &nbsp;The dangers lie in the dilution of the tradition, so that it loses it's integrity and power.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">The intervention will only be as good as the teacher who delivers it, and&nbsp;</span>their<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;grasp and embodiment of the practice in their own lives and&nbsp;</span>teaching practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Out of this awareness, we&nbsp;</span>have<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;been motivated to&nbsp;</span>develop<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;a high quality, transformative and rigorous training experience for those wishing to develop these skills and knowledge locally.</span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp; We have&nbsp;</span>developed<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;a training pathway which maintains strong connections with&nbsp;the contemplative traditions out of which MBIs have&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">developed,&nbsp;</span><em style="line-height: 1.428571429;">and</em><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;with the contemporary scientific exploration of mindfulness. &nbsp;In this way, we hope that the mindfulness programs offered in the region are<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">&nbsp;efficacious, contextually relevant, ethical and evidence-based.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">We hope that the &nbsp;training will offer a grounding in the relational, cognitive, emotional and body-based personal and professional development work necessary for good teaching. &nbsp; &nbsp;The training is targeted towards health professionals and others who wish:</span></p>
