<h1>The group: clinical and ethical issues for mindfulness teachers</h1>
<p>Teaching mindfulness groups &ndash; whether for clinical populations or in the general community &ndash; can mean that we are engaging with people with a diversity of issues and problems, both physical, mental and emotional.</p>
<p>In this workshop we will explore some useful ways of thinking about working with individuals who may be challenged by the practices, or who may be challenging for the group &ndash; because of their difficulties.</p>
<p>Practical, clinical and ethical decision-making leading to effective stewardship of the group and best care for each participant will be explored including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>listening well</li>
    <li>assessment and diagnosis</li>
    <li>containment</li>
    <li>group process</li>
    <li>providing extra support</li>
    <li>fear and optimism and their "near enemies"</li>
    <li>supervision and consultation</li>
    <li>referral to other help</li>
</ul>
<p>Dates, venues and teachers to be announced.</p>
