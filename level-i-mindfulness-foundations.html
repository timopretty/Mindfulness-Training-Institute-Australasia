	<h1>Level I: Mindfulness Foundations and Development</h1>
	<p>In this stage of training, you will undertake foundational experiential learning in the form of an investigation of mindfulness at the level of your own practice and it's impact and transformation in your life, as well as <a href="/silent-retreats">retreat</a> experience and some ongoing body-based practice. Conceptual understanding (through the Study Module) is integrated with practice-based explorations (in the Intensive) leading to integration of the personal and the professional which is so central in offering mindfulness.</p>
	<p>This program offers an experiential and theoretical grounding in mindfulness for those who are working in the helping professions and are interested in incorporating mindfulness in their work. It will help deepen your experience and understanding of mindfulness theory and practice to support your integration of mindfulness skills into your individual therapy work, and within ACT and DBT approaches. For those wishing to teach MBSR, MBCT or other MBIs, it will provide the groundwork to move into Level II training: teaching, supervision and certification.</p>
	<p>Assessment of readiness for entry into Level I training will be made on a case by case basis and take into account your personal and professional development and engagement in practice over time. (If you are relatively new to a sustained personal practice, you may be invited to take more time before enrolling in the Level I Intensive.)</p>
	<h2>Level I training involves:</h2>
	<h3>Study Module</h3>
	<p>This provides an opportunity for you to integrate their personal experience and understanding with theory (relevant contemplative and Western psychology) which informs and supports the delivery of mindfulness interventions. You will be asked to complete 2 essays (totalling up to 7000 words), which demonstrate your understanding of theory, research and practice relevant to mindfulness teaching. Details will be available on acceptance into the program. <a href="/pre-reading">Pre-reading</a> for the course is listed here. A range of articles and other resources will be provided on enrolment in the Study Module.</p>
	<h3>Eight day Intensive in MBIs</h3>
	<p>Completion of all prerequisites and Essay I of the Study Module is necessary to attend the 8 day Intensive.</p>
	<p>The eight day Intensive provides an in-depth residential context to explore a range of didactic, experiential and small group work. It will provide opportunities for practice teaching/leading with supervision from the instructors (usual teacher/student ratio 1:12). A strong emphasis in the Intensive is on the development and integration of personal and professional qualities which support authentic mindfulness teaching and learning. It offers a challenging and deepening process of exploration and engagement with self and others, using the ground of practice as our base. Specific areas of focus	will include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Refining and deepening personal mindfulness practice (through formal and informal practices, in silence and in dialogue)</li>
		<li>Integration of theory and practice</li>
		<li>Exploration of key aspects of the program including rationale of practices, group process, exercises, use of poetry/stories, leading and inquiring into	practice</li>
		<li>Exploring the value of mindfulness in attending to physical and emotional difficulties including depression, anxiety, pain and stress within ourselves and our participants</li>
		<li>On-going self-inquiry</li>
		<li>Exploration of readiness to teach</li>
	</ul>
	<p><em>Please note</em>: As part of the Intensive process, you will be expected to be very familiar with each of the mindfulness practices offered in MBSR and MBCT and will be	asked to lead them in dyads without scripts.</p>
