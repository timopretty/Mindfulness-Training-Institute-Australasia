        <h1>Costs</h1>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">We are aware that an in-depth MBI training process requires a commitment of time and money. We have ensured that our pathway is financially comparable to other equivalent courses offering MBI training in the world, and of equal standard. We are part of a worldwide network of teachers committed to high quality training in the MBIs.</span></p>
        <p>On this page we have listed all the costs involved up front. Please note that the costs below are a summary of all the aspects of training required to develop competencies and qualities over the course of the training including conceptual work, experiential training, retreats, supervision and assessment at certification. &nbsp; Trainees are free to undertake the training in a flexible time frame that supports their own learning needs, financial considerations and context.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Costs are in Australian dollars and include GST. &nbsp;</p>

        <p style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm;">Due to the generosity of a past trainee, a limited amount of funding is available to trainees <em>who require financial assistance in order to&nbsp;progress through the training pathway</em>.<em> &nbsp;</em>To make the program as accessible and diverse as possible, funding will be distributed in the form of &nbsp;fee help with supervision for two students per year.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0.1pt 0cm;">After completing the Intensive, you will be sent information about the criteria for applying for financial assistance with the costs of supervision. &nbsp;Accepted applicants will receive notification of the amount of supervision aid available to them.</p>
