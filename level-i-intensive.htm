        <h1>Level I: Intensive</h1>
		<h3>Eight Day Intensive in MBIs</h3>
		<p>Completion of all prerequisites and Essay I of the Study Module is necessary to attend the 8 day Intensive.</p>
		<p>The eight day Intensive provides an in-depth residential context to explore a range of didactic, experiential and small group work. It will provide opportunities for practice teaching/leading with supervision from the instructors (usual teacher/student ratio 1:12). A strong emphasis in the Intensive is on the development and integration of personal and professional qualities which support authentic mindfulness teaching and learning. It offers a challenging and deepening process of exploration and engagement with self and others, using the ground of practice as our base. Specific areas of focus	will include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Refining and deepening personal mindfulness practice (through formal and informal practices, in silence and in dialogue)</li>
			<li>Integration of theory and practice</li>
			<li>Exploration of key aspects of the program including rationale of practices, group process, exercises, use of poetry/stories, leading and inquiring into	practice</li>
			<li>Exploring the value of mindfulness in attending to physical and emotional difficulties including depression, anxiety, pain and stress within ourselves and our participants</li>
			<li>On-going self-inquiry</li>
			<li>Exploration of readiness to teach</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Please note</em>: As part of the Intensive process, you will be expected to be very familiar with each of the mindfulness practices offered in MBSR and MBCT and will be asked to lead them in dyads without scripts.</p>
